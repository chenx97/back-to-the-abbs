back to the abbs
================

Neta from "back to the future", a repository of AOSC OS build configurations that I don't think suitable in main AOSC abbs tree, containing excessive radical patches or configurations for non-free, non-redistributable packages.

I will not provide binary archives for packages here, nor users should redistribute copyright restricted packages build from these configurations. For instructions on how to build these packages for yourself, check AOSC cadet training on [main tree wiki](https://github.com/AOSC-Dev/aosc-os-abbs/wiki).

Users using packages here should check updates manually and re-build if there is any, as I cannot "push" updates without redistributing binaries.
